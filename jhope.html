         <div class="title"> J-HOPE - DYNAMITE</div>
         <div>
            <p><i>Dynamite</i>... what an <i>explosive</i> track! This is BTS’s latest smash hit single that topped the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and made the band the first South Korean act to do so. Both relevant to current times and a throwback to the music and styles of the 70s, <i>Dynamite</i> is an upbeat track that is meant to bring a smile to your face upon hearing it. It was definitely a nice breath of lightheartedness in a time shadowed by a global pandemic.</p>
            <p>I wholeheartedly agree with the entire internet that J-Hope stole the spotlight when the <i>Dynamite</i> concept photos were released. Everything was working for him in these pictures, from his undercut to his colored shades, beaded bracelets, textured pants, and warm eyeshadow. What a stunner!</p>
            <p>In addition to his good looks, the concept behind <i>Dynamite</i> suits J-Hope very well. Like his name suggests, J-Hope is described as the happy pill of BTS, always ready to cheer up the audience and members alike. He is also not afraid to take credit where it’s due, and that confidence only enhances his sunny personailty!</p>
            <p>As he is the main dancer of BTS, J-Hope is constantly in motion and in charge of helping others learn the choreography. Though times are tough, BTS has adapted by moving some of their live content online. It’s not the same, but J-Hope is always ready to greet his fans with a big smile and an energetic performance. </p>
            <p>Fun fact: bandmate RM agrees that black hair looks best on J-Hope!</p>
