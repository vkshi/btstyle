            <p><i>Love Yourself: Tear</i> was definitely Jungkook’s album. Released in May 2018, Jungkook was 20 waiting to turn 21. I guess he was tired of being BTS’s baby because the promotion period for <i>LY: Tear</i> and its featured track, <i>Fake Love</i>, became a promotion period for Jungkook’s chiseled abs.</p>
            <p>The youngest member of BTS, Jungkook use to be known as the most shy and emotional of the group, considering he was 15 when they debuted. He basically was raised by his bandmates and often says that his personality and talents are a conglomeration of theirs. It is definitely safe to say he has grown out of his shyness, since his muscular torso has been appearing more and more frequently during performances.</p>
            <p>Despite being the youngest, Jungkook is BTS’s center, which is a similar position to the “front man” of Western bands. He is also the group’s main vocal as well as a supporting visual. Overall, chances are you will be seeing and hearing Jungkook the most in anything BTS related.</p>
            <p>Jungkook’s position as the youngest meant he was in charge of being cute, as that is often expected of the youngest member in Korean pop culture. It is no secret that Jungkook does not enjoy acting cutesy for no reason. Since the release of LY: Tear, it is evident that Jungkook has been exploring his own personality and sense of style. Up until recently, Jungkook has been the most visually consistent member, but nowadays, he’s growing out his hair and getting tattoos!</p>
            <p>Fun fact: Jungkook once caused a shortage of Downy fabric softener because he accidentally revealed that his favorite scent was Downy’s Amber Blossom.</p>
