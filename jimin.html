         <div class="title"> JIMIN - BLACK SWAN</div>
         <div>
            <p><i>Black Swan</i> is a featured track from the most recent BTS studio album, <i>Map of the Soul: 7</i>. Like its predecessor, <i>Map of the Soul: Persona</i>, <i>MOTS: 7</i> is a homage to BTS’s career. While this album was in the making, BTS’s contract with Big Hit Entertainment was nearing its expiration, and the members had to decide whether or not to renew. This was a really tough period for the members, and they had considered disbanding. Those feelings were especially highlighted in Black Swan, as the song talks about the fear of falling out of love with making music.</p>
            <p>There is a very visual element to this track. BTS did not appear in the song’s original music video, which featured an interpretive dance by the MN Dance Company. For live performances, BTS had a seperate choreography, which clearly had elements of ballet, modern, and comtemporary dance styles. These elements played to Jimin’s strengths, as he was trained in contemporary dance before becoming an idol. In a surprise second music video for <i>Black Swan</i>, Jimin had solo choreography that demostrated how well he is able to convey emotions with his body. The fact that he had also donned on a corset for the shoot almost broke the internet!</p>
            <p>Additionally, while promoting for <i>Black Swan</i>,  Jimin was the only member with an unnatural hair color, which easily set him apart from the rest of the members. His small stature only highlighted his graceful movements. The combination of sweet eyes, full lips, and deep blue hair remininscent of feathers under limelight made Jimin <i>the</i> black swan of BTS.</p>
