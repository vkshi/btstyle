         <div class="title"> SUGA - HYYH: YF</div>
         <div>
            <p><i>The Most Beautiful Moment of Life</i> series (also abbreviated to <i>HYYH</i> from the Korean title), was the beginning of BTS’s rise to fame. What made it so popular was that it did not shy away from the issues of poverty, violence, abuse, neglect, self-harm, and powerlessness faced by youths. However, BTS added a touch of hope by highlighting the brotherhood between them, and how these bonds helped the characters they were portraying survive.</p>
            <p>There probably no one prouder than BTS Suga of the series’ success, since he had worked so hard and sacrificed so much just to pursue music as a career. In addition to his position as an idol, he also composes and produces for BTS as well as other artists. Suga is a credited composer for every track in the HYYH series.</p>
            <p>Suga also greatly relates to the themes of <i>HYYH</i>. He is one of the members who very open about his struggles with mental illness such as anxiety and depression. These issues are reflected in the character he portrays. which not only gives more life to the music he creates, but also hope to his audience when they listen to it.</p>
            <p>HYYH suits Suga quite well aesthetically too! Despite being one of the older members in the group, his small stature and fair skin gives him an innocent and youthful appearance. Decked out in shorts, a beret, and a face full of faux freckles, it is hard not to be immediately drawn to him!</p>
