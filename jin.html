         <div class="title"> JIN - WINGS</div>
         <div>
            <p>Wings was BTS’s 2016 album that openly embraced a sexy concept as well as themes of seduction, temptation, and forbidden love. This was also the first album to utilise solo songs, with each member having an individual track that they would sing alone, unlike their previous albums.</p>
            <p>Nicknamed “Worldwide Handsome,” there is no one more fitting of this concept than Jin, the oldest member of BTS. His role in the group ties in heavily with his good looks, as he is BTS’s main visual. That means he usualy gets more screentime than the other.</p>
            <p>Jin’s journey into BTS was an interesting one, as he didn’t audition for a spot. Instead, he was scouted off the streets due to his good looks! However, since Jin didn’t plan to become an idol, he had no background in music or dance. He had to work especially hard compare to his member to get where he is today.</p>
            <p>Jin’s solo track in the <i>Wings</i> album is called <i>Awake</i>. In the song, he talks being aware of the skills he is lacking. Still, the allure of being an idol is too great. Even though he is struggling, he wants to continue his career with the groupmates that he has become like family to him.</p>
            <p>Also during this era, Jin got to rock a pink hairdo! It is well known that Jin really likes the color pink. However, for a period of time, he was not allowed to wear pink items because he was ridiculed online for it. However, it seems more and more that Jin is getting reacquainted with his love for pink!
