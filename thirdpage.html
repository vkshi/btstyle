               <p>Over the years, BTS has tackled many concepts, often involving the themes of youth and growth. Their first popular album series, titled <i>The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 1</i> and <i>Part 2</i> tells the stories of seven struggling youths in high school, each affected by some sort of neglect or insecurty. However, despite their hardships, they are able to survive by befriending and confiding in each other. However, as these youths grow up, they are seperated, which sees them drowning in their indivual issues once again. One of the central messages conveyed by this series is definitely the importance of friendship, especially during times of struggle.</p>
               <p>Succeeding the <i>The Most Beautiful Moment in Life</i> series is the <i>Wings</i> and <i>You Never Walk Alone</i> duo. As their youngest member became of age during this time, BTS began to explore the ideas of seduction, temptation, and forbidden love. Their featured track, <i>Blood, Sweat & Tears</i> was what the group called their first “sexy” track. However, it is important to note that the themes explored were not always tied with sexuality. For example, in the <i>Wings</i> album, Jimin’s solo track <i>Lie</i> was about his struggle with having a eating disorder, and Suga’s solo track <i>First Love</i> was about his first piano.</p>
               <p>The largest album series of BTS to date is their <i>Love Yourself</i> series. Spanning three albums, and prefaced with a short film, the series starts with <i>Love Yourself: Wonder</i>, featuring the song <i>Euphoria</i> and showcasing the band members happily frolicking together and enjoying each others’ company. <i>Love Yourself: Her</i> then goes on to explores the excitement and giddiness of romantic love. <i>Love Yourself: Tear</i> include songs that talk about the negative sides of love, including heartbreak when relationships don’t work out. Finally, the series concluded with <i>Love Yourself: Answer</i>, which stressed the importance of loving and accepting oneself independent of outside influences. </p>
               <p>Following the <i>Love Yourself</i> series was the <i>Map of the Soul</i> series, which unfornately was shortened due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thought not as extensive as it predecessor, <i>Map of the Soul</i> was meant to be a reflection of BTS’s career. Most of the tracks in this album sampled previous BTS songs, and concepts from earlier years were re-explored. </p>
