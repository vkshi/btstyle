         <div class="title"> V - LY: Her</div>
         <div>
            <p><i>Love Yourself: Her</i> is the first album in the <i>Love Yourself</i> series and also the beginning of international fame for BTS. One of the most popular members of BTS, both domestically and internationally, is V. Why? Well his his striking features and soulful voice certainly plays to his benefit.</p>
            <p>Clearly around the time of this album release, puberty hit V like a full-speeding truck. He finally grew into those lanky limbs and big ears that we saw in the <i>HYYH</i> era. Paired with the curly silver hair, dangly earrings, and an ensemble from GUCCI, V earned himself the nickname “CGV.” The nickname is an acronym for “computer-generated graphic, V,” meaning that his level of handsomeness is so high, it is almost unreal. Now imagine that!</p>
            <p>Big Hit Entertainment of course capitalized on this increase of interest in V, giving him more screentime in the music video of the album’s featured track, <i>DNA</i>, as well as more lines in the song. But besides his growing popularity, the themes of <i>LY: Her</i> is very fitting for V, as he is the group’s romantic. A lot of his solo works, unrelated to BTS, are love songs.</p>
            <p>Around this time, there was also a shift in V’s personality, as he grew out of being a playful teenager at the start of BTS’s career into a more mature, definitely visually stunning young man. We don’t know if V has ever dated, but he sure does make his fans feel special during every peformance.</p>
